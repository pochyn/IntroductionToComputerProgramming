# IntroductionToComputerProgramming

Assignments for CSC108 in University of Toronto (UofT).
I used started codes, provided by course instructors, as well as my own code to finish assignments.
Assignments include TIC-TAC-TOE, string (en)decryption and twitterverse functions.
All asignments were graded with A or higher with 1 or 2 minor mistakes.
