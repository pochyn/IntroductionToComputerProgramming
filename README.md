# IntroductionToComputerProgramming

Assignments for one of the courses of University of Toronto (UofT).
I used starter codes, provided by course instructors, as well as my code to finish assignments.
Assignments include TIC-TAC-TOE, string (en)decryption and twitterverse works.

-- TIC-TAC-TOE - basic tictactoe game
-- string (en)decryption + twitterverse - working with python strings

All assignments were graded with A or higher.
